# 📁 CYB102 Data Dig: Brute-Force SSH Investigation

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset capturing brute-force authentication attempts against an SSH server. The logs include both failed and successful login attempts, allowing us to study attacker behavior, login patterns, and targeted accounts.

Using Splunk, VirusTotal, and Catalyst, we followed the NIST SP 800-61r3 Incident Response Playbook to investigate the incident, document findings, and recommend remediation steps.

This work was completed as part of CodePath CYB102 – Intermediate Cybersecurity.

## 📚 Dataset Description
The dataset was generated by a user who deployed an SSH server specifically to collect login activity for research.

It primarily includes:

- Repeated login attempts
- Brute-force activity
- Attackers trying many username/password combinations
- Source IP addresses (attacker)
- Target usernames

This dataset simulates how real brute-force network attacks behave in actual environments.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Splunk** — Log analysis, identifying attacker IPs and targeted accounts  
- **VirusTotal** — IP reputation lookup  
- **Catalyst** — Incident tracking, applying NIST playbook, and documenting findings  
- **NIST SP 800-61r3** — Incident response framework  

---

## 🧪 Investigation Summary (NIST Identify → Detect → Analyze)
Using Splunk, we:

- Identified the IP address responsible for the most login attempts  
- Confirmed that the `root` account was the primary target  
- Correlated attacker activity by pairing `foreign_ip` with `username`  
- Verified attacker IP reputation through VirusTotal  

Catalyst was used to track each step, add artifacts, and document findings in the Log.

---

## 🔒 Containment
- Blocked the attacker IP to stop additional login attempts  
- Locked the targeted user account  
- Applied rate-limiting to slow down brute-force attempts  

---

## 🧹 Eradication
To fully remove the threat, we would:

- Reset the targeted user’s password  
- Require stronger password policies  
- Enable MFA  
- Remove unauthorized sessions  
- Update firewall rules to block malicious IP ranges  
- Ensure no rogue SSH keys, accounts, or configurations remain  

---

## 🔧 Recovery
Once the threat was removed:

- Restore the user’s access after securing their account  
- Monitor Splunk logs for suspicious login attempts  
- Confirm firewall and authentication policies function correctly  
- Reinforce security education and preventative measures  

---

## 📘 Post-Incident Documentation & Remediation
We documented:

- Attacker IP  
- Attack timeline  
- Impacted user  
- Actions taken  

Recommended improvements:

- Stronger lockout policies  
- MFA enabled by default  
- Better monitoring for repeated failure patterns
