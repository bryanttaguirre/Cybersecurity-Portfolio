## Design Notes

- Public-facing services were intentionally placed in a DMZ to reduce risk to internal systems.
- Multiple firewalls were used to enforce trust boundaries between network zones.
- Active Directory was used to simulate centralized authentication and enterprise identity management.
- Security tooling was split between offensive (Kali) and defensive (Greenbone) systems to evaluate network posture.
