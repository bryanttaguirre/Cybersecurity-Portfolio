## Recommendations

Botium Toys has a few high-risk gaps that should be fixed as soon as possible. These are the main recommendations we should share with stakeholders to lower risk and improve the company’s security posture:

- Start implementing access controls like least privilege and separation of duties to limit access to sensitive data.  
- Add encryption for stored and transmitted credit card data to meet PCI DSS requirements.  
- Set up a centralized password management system and update password complexity requirements.  
- Build a real disaster recovery plan and ensure regular backups are in place.  
- Install an intrusion detection system (IDS) for better threat visibility.  
- Create an asset inventory and classify data to know what needs the most protection.  
- Make a consistent maintenance schedule for legacy systems.  
- Strengthen GDPR compliance by improving data privacy controls and securing E.U. customer data.
