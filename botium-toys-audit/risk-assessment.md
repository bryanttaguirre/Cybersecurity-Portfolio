## Risk Assessment

### Risk Description
Botium Toys lacks several essential security controls and does not appear to be fully compliant with U.S. or international standards. Asset management is incomplete, and sensitive data is not fully protected.

### Control Best Practices
Under the NIST CSF Identify function, Botium Toys needs to:
- Identify all assets  
- Classify data  
- Determine the business impact of loss or unavailability  

### Risk Score
**Risk Score: 8/10 (High)**  
This score reflects missing controls, weak compliance, and uncertainty around which assets are most at risk.

- No IDS is installed.  
- No disaster recovery plan exists, and **no backups** are maintained.
