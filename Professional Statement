I am a highly motivated and enthusiastic learner with a strong passion for cybersecurity. I am driven by the challenge of protecting organizations and individuals from evolving threats and closing security gaps before they can be exploited.
I value building strong security postures that help reduce risks, prevent data loss, and create safer digital environments for everyone. My interest in cybersecurity comes from wanting to make a real impact by protecting people and organizations where they are most vulnerable.
